generations:
  - name: "First Generation (LJ10/20)"
    start_year: 1970
    end_year: 1981
    description: "The first-generation Suzuki Jimny established the model's identity as a lightweight, minimalist off-roader designed to provide genuine four-wheel drive capability in a compact, affordable package. Initially known as the LJ (Light Jeep) series, the original Jimny featured a simple, boxy design with an open body style, though hardtop variants were later added. Measuring just 3 meters in length and weighing approximately 600 kg, the Jimny was exceptionally compact even by kei car standards. Early models were powered by a tiny 359cc two-stroke, two-cylinder engine producing just 25 horsepower to comply with Japanese kei car regulations, later upgraded to a 539cc version for export markets and eventually to a 797cc four-cylinder for the LJ80 variant. All models featured part-time four-wheel drive with a two-speed transfer case and leaf spring suspension front and rear. The interior was utterly basic with minimal comfort features, emphasizing function over form. Despite its modest power and simple construction, the first-generation Jimny established a reputation for remarkable off-road capability relative to its size, able to navigate challenging terrain thanks to its light weight, good ground clearance, and proper four-wheel drive system with low-range gearing. This generation laid the foundation for what would become one of the world's longest-running small 4×4 nameplates, finding particular success in rural and mountainous regions globally where its compact dimensions and off-road prowess proved invaluable."

  - name: "Second Generation (SJ30/40/410)"
    start_year: 1981
    end_year: 1998
    description: "The second-generation Suzuki Jimny, often known as the SJ series or Samurai in some markets, refined the concept established by its predecessor while broadening its appeal and capabilities. Available in various body styles including convertible soft top, hardtop, pickup, and long-wheelbase variants depending on market, this generation featured more angular styling with a distinctive slatted grille and rectangular headlights. Engine options expanded significantly, including 539cc and 657cc three-cylinder engines for Japanese kei car versions, with larger 1.0-liter and 1.3-liter four-cylinder engines for export markets, and even 1.9-liter turbodiesel options in some regions. All retained the part-time four-wheel drive system with a two-speed transfer case, though mechanical refinements improved reliability and capability. The suspension continued with leaf springs but with improved articulation and ride quality. The interior remained basic but offered more comfort features than the previous generation, particularly in later years and higher trim levels. This generation achieved global popularity, establishing the Jimny as a cult vehicle among off-road enthusiasts who appreciated its remarkable capability despite its humble origins. The SJ410/413 variants, in particular, developed a reputation for being able to follow much larger, more expensive 4×4s in challenging off-road situations while offering superior maneuverability in tight trails. Though controversy in some markets regarding rollover risk affected its image, the second-generation Jimny's lengthy production run and widespread global sales cemented its position as an iconic small off-roader."

  - name: "Third Generation (JB23/33/43/53)"
    start_year: 1998
    end_year: 2018
    description: "The third-generation Suzuki Jimny represented a significant modernization of the model while maintaining its core identity as a compact, capable off-roader. Featuring more rounded styling than its predecessors but retaining the boxy, upright profile and short overhangs essential for off-road performance, this generation was available primarily as a three-door hardtop, with some markets also receiving convertible variants in early years. In Japan, the kei car version (JB23) featured a 658cc turbocharged three-cylinder engine producing 63 horsepower to comply with regulations, while international models (JB33/43/53) received a larger 1.3-liter four-cylinder producing approximately 80-85 horsepower depending on market and emissions regulations. The most significant mechanical change was the switch from leaf springs to coil springs at all four corners, improving on-road ride quality and off-road articulation, while a switch to a ladder frame chassis provided improved rigidity. The part-time four-wheel drive system with low-range transfer case remained, now enhanced with electronic aids including ABS that could be switched off for off-road use, and in later models, limited-slip differential functionality through brake intervention. The interior offered significantly improved comfort, ergonomics, and safety compared to previous generations, though still maintaining a utilitarian character with hard-wearing materials and straightforward controls. Throughout its remarkably long 20-year production run, the third-generation Jimny received only modest updates to styling, equipment, and powertrains, a testament to the enduring appeal of its fundamental design. This generation further enhanced the Jimny's cult status among off-road enthusiasts who appreciated its combination of genuine capability, compact dimensions, mechanical simplicity, and distinctive character in an era of increasingly car-like crossovers."

  - name: "Fourth Generation (JB64/74)"
    start_year: 2018
    end_year: null
    description: "The fourth-generation Suzuki Jimny marks a return to more angular, retro-inspired styling while thoroughly modernizing the mechanical package and technology. The distinctive exterior design incorporates elements reminiscent of earlier generations, including a simple rectangular grille with vertical slats, circular headlights, and an upright, boxy silhouette with similarly minimalist dimensions to its predecessor. In Japan, the kei car version (JB64) features a 658cc turbocharged three-cylinder engine producing 63 horsepower to comply with regulations, while the global model (JB74) receives a naturally aspirated 1.5-liter four-cylinder producing 100-102 horsepower depending on market, both significant improvements in performance over the previous generation. Both variants maintain the traditional Jimny formula of body-on-frame construction, rigid axles front and rear with coil springs, and part-time four-wheel drive with a proper low-range transfer case, now enhanced with electronic aids including brake LSD traction control, hill descent control, and hill hold assist. The interior represents the most significant advancement, featuring modern design with enhanced ergonomics, improved materials, and significantly updated technology including a 7-inch touchscreen infotainment system with smartphone connectivity on higher trim levels. Safety equipment has been comprehensively upgraded with the addition of autonomous emergency braking, lane departure warning, and six airbags as standard in most markets. Despite these modernizations, the fourth-generation Jimny maintains its focus on off-road capability with exceptional approach, breakover, and departure angles, good ground clearance, and a lightweight structure enhancing performance in challenging terrain. The new model has achieved unprecedented global demand, often exceeding production capacity, thanks to its distinctive design, genuine capability, and unique positioning as one of the few remaining small, purpose-built off-roaders in an era dominated by car-based crossovers. Regulatory challenges in some markets, particularly concerning emissions, have led to creative solutions including a commercial vehicle variant with rear seats removed in European markets."
